main points to run contiki-ng + cooja over HPC server:

- if I change something in java source of cooja, I have to compile the cooja file to be affected. to do so I should 
  compile it inside Docker container: contiker
    - contiker
    - cd contiki-ng/tools/cooja
    - ant run
- you should enable headless setting in the cooja dir -> follow this link: https://github.com/cetic/cooja-radiologger-headless
